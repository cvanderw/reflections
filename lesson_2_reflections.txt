What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Initializing a repository is necessary for creating the .git folder and
metadata for tracking the Git repository. Without this step, it's not possible
for Git to provide repository management since there isn't anything to support
the history and files related to the repository. From what I saw it looks like
this is largely a collection of text files so I suppose some of this can be
created by hand (although that sounds ugly) but if there are any binary files
created for tracking by Git then this is not going to work.
