When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Having a remote repository is helpful for a number of reasons:
- A remote repo allows for easier sharing and collaboration with others.
- A remote provides a backup in case local work is lost.
- Even if you never decide to work with others, a remote repo still has the benefit of
  allowing you to pull down the changes on a different computer to continue work there.



Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

By requiring manual pulls users are free to keep their repositories isolated
and independent from each other. Git seems to encourage branching for feature
development. However, it's not always necessary to have access to every single
branch nor to track every single change. By having users manually pull changes
they are free to decide what to include and what not to.
