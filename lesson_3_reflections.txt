When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Having a remote repository is helpful for a number of reasons:
- A remote repo allows for easier sharing and collaboration with others.
- A remote provides a backup in case local work is lost.
- Even if you never decide to work with others, a remote repo still has the benefit of
  allowing you to pull down the changes on a different computer to continue work there.
